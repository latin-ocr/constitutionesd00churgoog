marriage, which should be produced ii the ecclesiastical record
does not iumish such data. The certificate oi divorce should
be presented il the parties to the contested marriage have been
divorced. The present residence oi the parties to the con-
tested marriage, andos all important witnesses, must also be
iumished together with sufficient assurance oi their avail·
ability to warrant their being cited.

5. The requisite documeuts, together with a petition out-
lining the case, should be sent to Chancery. The petition should
be made in the name oi the Catholic person only.

6. Priests should, in justice, offer no encouragement to
a person secking a declaration oi nullity unless all the require-
ments above indicated as essential can be fulfilled. The
decision that an attempted marriage was invalid is one of the
most serious that a Bishop is called upon to make, and is sur-
rounded by the Church with most stringent saleguards. No
petitiones, therefore, can entertain hope oi marriage until
the Church has given a decision in his favor; and until such
a decision has been placed in his hands no Priest should assign
a time ior a marriage or' cmmtenance the least preparation ior
its celebration.

7. Notice oi the decree oi nullity issued by the Matrimonial .
Court must be iorwarded to the place oi Baptism oi the party ι
or parties oonoemed ior reoording.

8. The fee stipulated in each case by the Court and indi-
oeted at the time oi promulgation ot the Decree must be
paid to Chancery, the regulation above in F, (c) holding in cases
oi those described therein.
